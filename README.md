🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Friend Suggestion System using Graphs (DSA + Python + NetworkX)
This is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how graph data structures are used in real-world applications like social networks.

The system suggests new friends to a user based on mutual friends, similar to how platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn work.

📌 Features:
👤 Add a new user to the system

🤝 Create a friendship (edge) between two users

📃 View all friends of a user

💡 Suggest new friends using mutual connections (2-hop neighbors)

📊 Visualize the social network graph using networkx and matplotlib

⚙️ Technologies Used:
Python 3

NetworkX – for graph representation

Matplotlib – for graph visualization (optional GUI)

CLI-based input (with an optional GUI version coming soon)

🧠 DSA Concepts Used:
Graph Representation: Undirected graph using an adjacency list

Graph Traversal: 2-level depth for mutual friend suggestions

Real-World Use Case: Simulates friend recommendations in social networks

Graph Visualization: See connections in a plotted network
